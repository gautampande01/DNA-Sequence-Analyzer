# DNA-Sequence-Analyzer
Python-based DNA sequence analyzer that performs cleaning, GC content, transcription, translation, primer design, and BLAST integration. Built as a beginner project to apply bioinformatics logic with real biological data.

A Python-based bioinformatics project that performs essential DNA sequence analysis:

✅ Sequence Cleaning – Removes invalid characters and standardizes input

📏 Length & GC Content – Calculates total length and GC percentage

🔁 Reverse Complement – Generates the complementary DNA strand

💬 Transcription – Converts DNA to mRNA sequence

🧬 Translation – Translates DNA to protein using codon table

🧪 Primer Design – Generates forward and reverse primers

📈 Primer Stats – Evaluates GC%, melting temperature (Tm), and quality

🌐 NCBI BLAST Integration – (Optional) Checks primer similarity to known genomic sequences
